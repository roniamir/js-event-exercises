Why in the code below return false doesn’t work at all?

-the returned "false" is not reaching to anything, and the function dosent include any defult browser canceling action.

The browser follows the URL on click, but we don’t want it.
How to fix?

-to fix we need to add event.preventDefault(); which cancel the defult browser action (open the link).
